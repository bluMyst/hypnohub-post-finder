        # There's a problem with just blindly going through all the posts in
        # numerical order. And that problem is:
        #
        # The Post model has a 'parent' field, and this field *has* to refer
        # to another Post, or be set to 'null'. But what if the parent has a
        # higher ID than the child? We won't be able to save it with the
        # 'parent' field set, because we don't have any record of the post it's
        # refering to, yet. Here's my solution:
        #
        # We'll go through every post on the site and try to turn them all into
        # Posts. As we're doing this, we'll set aside any posts with a 'parent'
        # that we haven't saved yet. We'll put them all in a list called
        # 'temporary_orphans'.
        #
        # Then, after we're done with every post that isn't a temporary_orphan,
        # we'll do the same process with the orphans themselves: Go through
        # each one and check if we can turn them into a savable Post. If not,
        # we'll save them for later... again.
        #
        # At this point there's a fork in the road. Either we've managed to
        # save at least one orphan, or we haven't.
        #
        # If we haven't, there's no point in trying again. We'd just loop
        # infinitely. So the best we can do is to print the ID's of the Posts
        # we're having trouble with, and save them with 'parent' set to 'null'.
        #
        # But if we *have* saved at least one, that means we need to try the
        # other orphans again. After all, the saved posts are almost definitely
        # the parents of some of the orphans on our list. And at this point we
        # just keep looping until we run out of orphans or we stop making
        # progress.
        #
        # By the way, it's probably best to go through posts in ascending
        # order, by ID. Because that way we'll process old posts first, then
        # new posts. And a child post is very likely to have been created
        # *after* its parent, and not before.
