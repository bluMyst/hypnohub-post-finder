# Before you get too deep into this file, let me explain something:
#
# There's a problem with just blindly going through all the posts in
# numerical order, and saving them one by one. That problem is:
#
# The Post model has a 'parent' field, and this field *has* to refer
# to another Post, or be set to 'null'. But what if the parent has a
# higher ID than the child? We won't be able to save it with the
# 'parent' field set, because we don't have any record of the post it's
# refering to, yet. Here's my solution:
#
# We'll go through every post on the site and try to turn them all into
# Posts. As we're doing this, we'll set aside any posts with a 'parent'
# that we haven't saved yet. We'll put them all in a list called
# 'temporary_orphans'.
#
# Then, after we're done with every post that isn't a temporary_orphan,
# we'll do the same process with the orphans themselves: Go through
# each one and check if we can turn them into a savable Post. If not,
# we'll save them for later... again.
#
# At this point there's a fork in the road. Either we've managed to
# save at least one orphan, or we haven't.
#
# If we haven't, there's no point in trying again. We'd just loop
# infinitely. So the best we can do is to print the ID's of the Posts
# we're having trouble with, and save them with 'parent' set to 'null'.
#
# But if we *have* saved at least one, that means we need to try the
# other orphans again. After all, the saved posts are almost definitely
# the parents of some of the orphans on our list. And at this point we
# just keep looping until we run out of orphans or we stop making
# progress.
#
# By the way, it's probably best to go through posts in ascending
# order, by ID. Because that way we'll process old posts first, then
# new posts. And a child post is very likely to have been created
# *after* its parent, and not before.
