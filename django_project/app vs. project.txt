The art of creating and maintaining a good Django app is that it should follow
the truncated Unix philosophy according to Douglas McIlroy: "Write programs
that do one thing and do it well".

Again the authors state:

In essence, each app should be tightly focused on its task. If an app can’t be
explained in a single sentence of moderate length, or you need to say ‘and’
more than once, it probably means the app is too big and should be broken up.

Since I don't understand enough about how apps work, and if apps can "see" data
from other apps, I'm just going to make one big app for now. And I'll break it
up later.
