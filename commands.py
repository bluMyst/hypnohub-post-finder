"""
Takes a command from sys.argv. Basically a low-level CLI frontend to the rest
of my code, for doing things that you can't yet do from HTTP.
"""

# TODO: Everything here should be possible from within the HTTP interface.
# Except, obviously, the "serve" command which should be its own file. Probably
# called "run" or something.
#
# Update:
# - How do we keep the user updated on our progress? This command could take a
#   *very* long time to complete. Maybe some sort of realtime link between
#   client and server that's handeled by its own dedicated class?
#
# Validate:
# - Same problem as above.
#
# Reset cache:
# - Easy to do, but be careful! We should have a /misc_controls page, and then a
#   /javascript/reset_cache page for the Javascript to GET, once we've confirmed
#   that the user knows what they're doing.
#
# Record votes:
# - Figure out how to make an HTML form, and prompt with an ok/cancel popup
#   before doing it.
#
# Check deleted:
# - This will require some complex-ish communications between client and server.
#   We might have to store a cookie to know who is who.
