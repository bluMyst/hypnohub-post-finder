Here's what's going on:

I want to show the user posts based on a Naive Bayes Classifier's best guess
on how they'll like it.

However, the script can also be started in a "training" mode where we'll ask
the user what they think of totally random posts. They can either thumb them
up or thumb them down, and we'll add them to the dataset.

I don't want to have the user vote on stuff that the Classifier is
predicting the user will like, because it seems like we'd start having a
biased dataset.

Speaking of which, this is what the dataset needs to look like: A list of
good posts, by ID and a list of bad posts, by ID. Ideally the tags should be
stored, too.

Also, let's find a way to cache a list of all posts on Hypnohub. Just their
URL's, image URL's, and tags. It's only polite. But every time we start up
this script, it should download data on any new images.

However, we need to make sure that ID's and URL's all stay the same no
matter what. Can probably just ask.  Seems likely, because of all those
"image not found" images we keep getting.

        Give it some Post's with tags and it'll try to guess which ones you'll like
        in the future.

        How it works:

        Bayes's Theorem says:

        P(A | B) = P(B | A) * P(A) / P(B)

        Let's say that we want to know how likely someone is to like a certain
        Post.  The best indicator for this is the tags. Let's say that 'G' is
        the statement "this post is good", and 'T0' is the statement "this post
        has tag number 0".

        P(G | T0) = P(T0 | G) * P(G) / P(T0)

        This would work really well if we only had one tag to deal with, but
        let's say there are multiple tags: T0, T1, T2, ...

        I'm going to use the caret (^) symbol in place of the logical AND symbol.

        P(G | T0 ^ T1 ^ ... ^ Tn) = P(T0 ^ T1 ^ ... ^ Tn | G) * P(G) / P(T0 ^ T1 ^ ... ^ Tn)

        Well that won't work at all! P(T0 ^ T1 ^ ...) will only match something
        with exactly identical tags, and we almost definitely don't have
        anything like that in our dataset.

        Let's try something else. Let's intentionally make a bad(ish) assumption
        and say that the tags are conditionally independent. Meaning that a post
        with T0 is just as likely to have T1 as a post without. (P(T0 ^ T1) =
        P(T0 ^ !T1)).  For conditionally independent tags:

        P(X ^ Y | Z) = P(X | Z) * P(Y | Z)

        So let's go back to our multi-tag problem:

        P(G | T0 ^ T1 ^ ... ^ Tn) = P(T0 ^ T1 ^ ... ^ Tn | G) * P(G) / P(T0 ^ T1 ^ ... ^ Tn)

        Let TGP be the "tag is good proportion" of all tags that we're
        interested in combined. This isn't the proportion of good posts that
        have all of the tags. In the vast majority of cases, our data is too
        limited to get anything useful out of a query like that. We might find
        one other post.  Instead, this is an extrapolation based on our
        incomplete data.

        TGP = P(G | T0 ^ T1 ^ ... ^ Tn) = P(T0 | G) * P(T1 | G) * ... * P(Tn | G)

        Let TP be the "has tag proportion" of all tags in all posts we have data
        on.  This is another extrapolation, using the same method as above.

        TP = P(T0 ^ T1 ^ ... ^ Tn) = P(T0) * P(T1) * ... * P(Tn)

        So basically, for a post with tags [T0, T1, ..., Tn]:

        P(G | T0 ^ T1 ^ ... ^ Tn) = TGP * P(G) / TP
