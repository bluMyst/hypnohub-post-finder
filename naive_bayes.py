""" Here's what's going on:

I want to show the user posts based on a Naive Bayes Classifier's best guess
on how they'll like it.

However, the script can also be started in a "training" mode where we'll ask
the user what they think of totally random posts. They can either thumb them
up or thumb them down, and we'll add them to the dataset.

I don't want to have the user vote on stuff that the Classifier is
predicting the user will like, because it seems like we'd start having a
biased dataset. We should find out for sure, though.

We need to make sure that ID's all stay the same no matter what. Can probably
just ask. Seems likely, because of all those deleted posts and blank spots in
the ID list.

class NaiveBayesClassifier(object):
    """
    Give it some Post's with tags and it'll try to guess which ones you'll like
    in the future.

    Don't expect this class to always have predictions <= 1.0. The naive
    assumption fucks with the numbers a lot and it can get crazy high.

    How it works:

    Well first of all, let's talk about syntax. Math is INCREDIBLY hard to do
    in UTF-8, or really any computerized format, so I'm just going to make some
    stuff up:

    syntax         | meaning
    P(A)           | The probability of statement 'A' being true.
    P(A|B)         | The probability of 'A' being true, assuming 'B' is true.
    A&B            | A and B
    pi{i=0->5}(i)  | The pi notation of i=0 to 5, multiplying i. In other
                   | words: 0*1*2*3*4*5

    Bayes's Theorem says, given evidence E and a state we're interested in S:

    P(S|E) = P(E|S) * P(S) / P(E)

    Let's say that we want to know how likely someone is to like a certain
    Post. The best indicator for this is the tags. Let's say that 'G' is
    the statement "this post is good", and 'T0' is the statement "this post
    has tag number 0".

    P(G| 0) = P(T0|G) * P(G) / P(T0)

    This would work really well if we only had one tag to deal with, but
    let's say we're looking at a Post with "n" tags: T0, T1, T2, ..., Tn

    Ta = pi{i=0->n}(Tn)
    P(G|Ta) = P(Ta|G) * P(G) / P(Ta)

    Well that won't work at all! P(Ta) will only match something
    with exactly identical tags, and we almost definitely don't have
    anything like /that/ in our dataset.

    Let's try something else. Let's intentionally make a bad(ish) assumption
    and say that the tags are conditionally independent. Meaning that a post
    with T0 is just as likely to have T1 as a post without. In other words,
    let's assume:

    P(T0|T1) = P(T0|!T1)

    Why are we making this assumption? Because for conditionally independent
    tags:

    P(X&Y|Z) = P(X|Z) * P(Y|Z)
    P(X&Y)   = P(X) * P(Y)

    So let's go back to our multi-tag problem:

    P(G|Ta) = P(Ta|G) * P(G) / P(Ta)
    P(G|Ta) = P(G) * P(Ta|G) / P(Ta)

    Make sense? I hope so! Anyway, we can simplify the above equation down to:

    P(G | Ta) = P(G) * pi{i=0->n}( P(Ti | G) / P(Ti) )

    Now check out this pseudocode:

    answer = P(G)
    for tag in tags:
        answer *= P(tag | G) / P(tag)

    That's all it takes!
